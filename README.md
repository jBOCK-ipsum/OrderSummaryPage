Lorem ipsum... just joking!

This mini project was used as my r-introduction to HTML5 and CSS3. 
Through such projects and pages I plan on developing my design and development skills to the point where I am familiar with concepts, terminilogy, libraries, and framework.

I am all self taught, and am looking forward to learning more throughout my frontend development framework.
